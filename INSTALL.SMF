These instructions talk about how to configure ldap2dns to work with
Solaris 10's Service Management Framework (SMF).

Start by importing the SMF manifest into the running configuration:
$ sudo svccfg import ldap2dns.xml

This imports the manifest but does not attempt to start the service.  It also
seeds a number of important environment variables which will replace the
command-line options to instruct ldap2dns how to behave.

Note that there is currently (2006/12/27) a bug in svccfg which prevents the
svccfg utility from setting environment variables whose values contain the
equals ('=') sign.  Since LDAP DNs contain the equals sign, a workaround is
required.  Unfortunately it has the side effect of erasing any existing
environment variables set for the service.  Thus, you must set the
LDAP2DNS_BASEDN and LDAP2DNS_BINDDN before setting any other variables.  This
will be true of any variable whose value contains the equals sign.

The following variables are the minimum required to make ldap2dns function:
LDAP2DNS_HOST (Can be ignored if the LDAP server is localhost)
LDAP2DNS_BASEDN (Can be ignored if /etc/ldap.conf is properly configured)
LDAP2DNS_BINDDN (Can be ignored if binding anonymously or ldap.conf is setup)
LDAP2DNS_PASSWORD (Can be ignored if binding anonymously or ldap.conf is setup)
LDAP2DNS_OUTPUT (one of "data" or "db" for TinyDNS or BIND respectively)
TINYDNS_DIR (Only if using TinyDNS output)
LDAP2DNS_DAEMONIZE (Must be set to non-null value)

Also, you'll most likely want to set LDAP2DNS_EXEC to have the name service
notified when changes occur.

After importing the manifest, execute the following command to set any required
environment variables that contain the equals sign.  Here is an example which
sets BASEDN and BINDDN:

$ sudo svccfg -s ldap2dns:default 'setprop start/environment = astring: ("LDAP2DNS_BASEDN=ou=DNS,dc=alkaloid,dc=net" "LDAP2DNS_BINDDN=uid=ldap2dns,ou=People,dc=alkaloid,dc=net")'

Note that is one continuous line.  The single quotes are required to ensure the
shell does not attempt to interpret the parenthesis.  The parenthesis are
required to ensure that svccfg interprets the two quoted values as a single
value.  The quotes are required to separate the environment variables in SMF.

If you are running multiple instances of ldap2dns, make sure you replace
":default" with the name of the instance you want to configure.

Once you've set up the variables containing equals signs, continue by setting
any remaining required variables:
$ sudo svccfg -s ldap2dns:default setenv -m start LDAP2DNS_PASSWORD secret
$ sudo svccfg -s ldap2dns:default setenv -m start LDAP2DNS_HOST ldap.example.com
$ sudo svccfg -s ldap2dns:default setenv -m start LDAP2DNS_TINYDNSDIR /etc/tinydns/root
$ sudo svccfg -s ldap2dns:default setenv -m start LDAP2DNS_OUTPUT data
$ sudo svccfg -s ldap2dns:default setenv -m start LDAP2DNS_DAEMONIZE true


When complete, let SMF know it needs to re-read the configuration for the
service:
$ sudo svcadm refresh ldap2dns:default

If you want to check your work, execute the following command to dump the 
configured environment (note this only works after refreshing the service; to
check before refreshing you must use svccfg):
$ sudo svcprop -p start/environment ldap2dns:default

Finally, once everything looks good, start up ldap2dns:
$ sudo svcadm enable ldap2dns:default

Check for any errors:
$ svcs -vx ldap2dns:default
svc:/application/management/ldap2dns:default (LDAP to DNS manager)
 State: online since Wed Dec 27 15:12:51 2006
   See: man -M /usr/man -s 1 ldap2dns
   See: /var/svc/log/application-management-ldap2dns:default.log
Impact: None.

Looks good!  In case the state does not read "online" for any reason, check
the log file at /var/svc/log/application-management-ldap2dns:default.log
